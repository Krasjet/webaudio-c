webaudio-c
==========

A simple WebAudio sine oscillator using WASM compiled from C.

Probably the simplest example for using WASM in WebAudio. No
C++, no Rust, no Emscripten wrapper, just plain C and some
JavaScript. Works on the latest version of both Firefox and
Chrome.

Build
-----

You must have Emscripten [1] installed to build the example.
You technically only need Clang and WASI [2], but emcc will
make your life much easier.

If you are using ArchLinux or macOS, there are binary
packages available:

  ArchLinux:

    $ pacman -S emscripten

  macOS:

    $ brew install emscripten

Otherwise follow the documentation to install it [3].

Then run

  $ make

to build the WASM module.

Test
----

To test the webpage locally, you *must* set up a local
server in the current directory to get over the cross-origin
resource sharing restriction [4] imposed by modern browsers.

To do this, you can use the built-in HTTP server in Python:

  $ python3 -m http.server 8000

This creates a local HTTP server on port 8000. Then go to
the URL

  http://localhost:8000

in the browser.
